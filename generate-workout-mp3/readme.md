# Motivation

While searching for an Android program for interval workouts, 
I encountered the problem that the options did not suit me for various reasons.

The idea arose that the sequence of exercises could simply be recorded as an mp3 file and played 
in the background.

The idea turned out to be a good replacement for various timers like the Pomodoro technique.

# Usage options

```
just build
just run 
```

1. Simply create a workout (presets)

2. Record each exercise separately and form a workout playlist.
